# FluteCraft

A web application for calculating precise hole positions when crafting traditional wind instruments, specifically focused on wood flutes. The tool bridges ancient musical traditions with modern acoustic physics, helping makers achieve accurate tuning without expensive measurement equipment.

## Features

- **Three Calculation Methods**:
  - Xiao - Sanfen Sunyi Method (Ancient Chinese mathematical system)
  - Acoustical Physics Method (Reverse engineering with measurement feedback)
  - Benade's Formula (Woodwind research)

- **Bilingual Support**: French and English
- **Real-time Calculations**: Instant feedback as you adjust parameters
- **Measurement Workflow**: Iterative refinement with actual measurements
